# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

### Table of contents

##[The challenge]
My challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help you complete the challenge.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


##[My process]
1. Layout the foundation of the page on the "index.html". (Eg: The heading, paragraphs, prices, images)
2. Create a "style.css" file and link it to "index.html"
3. Download and import the text-font required based on the instructions
4. Reference the images provided by the challenge.
5. Utilised CSS to style to page based on the images


#[Built with]
- VStudio utilising HTML and CSS


#[What I learned]
- Learnt the basics of constructing a simple page with simple interactive elements.
- Understand and familiarise myself with the basics of how HTML and CSS function within VStudio
- Understood the importance of having an appealing page


#[Continued development]
These are a list of projects I am going to try out over the coming months:
- Interactive Portfolio Website
- QR Code Creation
- Creating a simple game
